# Global-Wheat-Detection
This is a Deep Learning project which is used to detect the wheat head in the fields. The data is images of wheat fields, with bounding boxes for each identified wheat head. The CSV data is simple - the image ID matches up with the filename of a given image, and the width and height of the image are included, along with a bounding box. There is a row in train.csv for each bounding box. Not all images have bounding boxes.
